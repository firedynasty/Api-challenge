## WeatherPy Challenge

In this activity, the goal is to find differences of temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed between cities spaced apart from the equator latitudinally.

From the results, it appears that there is strong correlation between temperature and where the city is located. As a city is farther away from the equator, the city has colder temperatures.

There is not much correlation between temperature, humidity, and cloudiness, comparing different cities latitudinally.

The library Citipy was used to generate the city names. The library random was used to generate random numbers between -180 to 180 for the longitude, and -90 to 90 for the latitude. The number of cities generated was over 500.

The API call to Openweather API responded with data of the cities, and the data of latitude, max_temp, humidity, cloudiness, windspeed, country, and time were returned as lists. The DataFrame by the name of cities_info_df was created from these lists.

Pandas Plot was used to plot between latitude and the temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and the wind speed.

Regression lines and R values were applied to the graphs.

The graphs with correlation are shown below (between latitude and temperature):

It should be noted that there is stronger correlation between the cities in the Northern Hemisphere vs. the Souther Hemisphere (0.71 vs 0.46)

## VacationPy Challenge


The city that has the ideal temperature today was Portland, between 70 and 80, with slow windspeed, and clear skies.  It would be nice when everything returns to normal to take a trip and visit.  Portland's Travel site offers "The city’s arts offerings come into full swing every fall, with a seemingly endless array of things to do, see and experience."

From the city dataset that was generated from `WeatherPy` Challenge, it was used to generate a heatmap using Gmaps to show the relative humidity throughout the world.  The green spots were the least humid with a few points across the Saharan Desert (probably small towns that returned by library Citipy).  

The cities with the best temperatures were plotted on top of the heatmap, and it doesn't look like there is much correlation between them except that they look to be somewhat equally spaced from the equator in distance.
